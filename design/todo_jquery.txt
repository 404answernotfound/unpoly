- Update docs
- Specs should load jQuery with noConflict and only assign $ = jQuery at the top of each spec file
- Get rid of u.addClass, u.writeInlineStyle, u.fastHide, etc. if possible
- Move all remaining element-related helper methods from util to query
- Remove event.element, event.$element, event.$target options for up.emit() (only support { target })
- Check if we really need to do e.get(...) in every single function that works with elements
  - Do we really need to support `elementOrSelector` instead of just `element` in the public API?
- Move duplicate u.element when we already have e.get
- Remove 'none' default for animation options in link.follow etc.
- Remove 'auto' default from { layer, failLayer } in link, modal, popup
- rename up.element to up.element
  - e.list()
- rename up.dom to up.fragment
- grip everything for "$" once again

- upgrade roca-style.org PR
- migration guide
  - jquery event listeners need to use addEventListener or use event.originalEvent
