- build up.$on
- build up.$observe
- Update docs
  - Examples with $
  - Stuff like  @param {jQuery} event.link
  - document new stuff like up.$compiler
- Specs should load jQuery with noConflict and only assign $ = jQuery at the top of each spec file
- Move all remaining element-related helper methods from util to query
  - Get rid of u.addClass, u.writeInlineStyle, u.fastHide, etc. if possible
- Remove event.element, event.$element, event.$target options for up.emit() (only support { target })
- Check if we really need to do e.get(...) in every single function that works with elements
  - Do we really need to support `elementOrSelector` instead of just `element` in the public API?
- Move duplicate u.element when we already have e.get
- Remove 'none' default for animation options in link.follow etc.
- Remove 'auto' default from { layer, failLayer } in link, modal, popup
- rename up.dom to up.fragment
- grep everything for "$" once again
- grep for TODO comments
- migration guide
  - jquery event listeners need to use addEventListener or use event.originalEvent
- refactor motion tracker
  - can we write CssTransition as a motion with start/finish methods? that does not register finish events?
  - also unify claim/claim2 or rename them
- upgrade roca-style.org PR
- implement up.$animation
- implement up.$animate
- implement up.$morph
- implement up.$transition
- consider renaming wrapCollection / isCollection to wrapList / isList
- support smooth-scrolling to an existing #anchor in the current page, to justify all that animation code
- support this syntax:
  - <a href="#foo" up-scroll="smooth" up-scroll-speed="3">
  - [up-scroll] should make a link followable (if it is not already)
- scrolling to #hash should also find [up-id], to prevent jumping of browser
