New features (postponable)
--------------------------

- support smooth-scrolling to an existing #anchor in the current page, to justify all that animation code
  - basically [up-follow] should check:
    - if the link href includes "#"
      - is the (normalized source of the target | the current URL) the URL of the link (or is it only a hash)
      - does the hash anchor exist in the current page
      - if yes, scroll to it and resolve the replacemnet
      - if no, do a usual replacement
  - who parses [up-scroll-behavior] and [up-scroll-speed] from <links>?
  - rename "page" layer to "root"
