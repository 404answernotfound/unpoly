- Remove up.tooltip module
  - Remove with deprecating macro that sets [title] for [up-tooltip]
- Build up.change
- Think about whether to keep up.replace and up.extract
- .up-layer-viewport should have { overscroll-behavior: contain }
- u.only and u.except should take an array
- Simplify z-index for layers
  - I think we only need a z-index on .up-layers and let stacking context do the rest
- Test that clicking on the layer backdrop will cause dismiss on iOS (https://code.makandra.de/makandra/studyflix/commit/cf7d016a1d00797519b709cfcb27423c6adea9d2)
- Test that [up-dismiss][up-follow] inside a layer will dismiss
- Test that [up-dismiss][up-follow] outside a layer will follow


Finishing up
------------

- Grep for TODO
- Test in all browsers
- Migrate cards



Accessibility
--------------

- A11Y: current layer should get [role=dialog] and [aria-modal=true], all parent layers should get [inert] and [aria-hidden: true]. Since the root layer has no containers, we should apply this to direct children
- A11Y: check if [inert] etc. are enough to have the browser rotate focus within the layer
- A11Y: opening a layer should focus the layer, optionally to [autofocus]
- A11Y: closing a layer should focus the element that opened the layer


Bootstrap integration
---------------------

- update or stop supporting unpoly-boostrap3
- should we have unpoly-bootstrap4?


Later?
------

- Turn property-like API symbols into getter
  - e.g. up.layer.root instead of up.layer.root()
  - e.g. up.layer.current instead of up.layer.current()
- Support [up-target][up-class] and [up-target][up-fail-class] to set a class on the new fragment
  - But think how that would go together with [up-layer="new"][up-class="warning"]
