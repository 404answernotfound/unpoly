What don't I like at the current logging behavior:

- The grouping doesn't work as well as I hoped
  - Errors get lost
  - Groups are always visible!

Also generally about debugging:

- The red .up-error box truncates the message
  
  
Ideas
-----

- Wait for printing a group until I know if there has been an error in this frame
- Make .up-error a scrollable box that shows the full error messages
- Make all logging opt-in
