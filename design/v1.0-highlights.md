Layers
------

Infiniftely nested layers

Layers can be accepted or dismissed, with a result value

Layer changes are fully isolated. User navigation cannot accidentally target another layer, you need to explicitely use [up-layer].


Server integration
------------------

Server can close layers

Server can emit events

Rails: Values survive redirect

Server: Knows if a request targets an overlay



Context
-------

It's a virtual cookie for the current tab

Not actual a cookie

Layer-specific

Can be read and changed from the server

Layers without history silence history entirely, even for subsequent navigations and child layers



A11Y
----

up-nav sets [aria-current]

focus cycle in layers

focus controllable by user

Already backported to 0.62:

- Links with an [`[up-instant]`](/a-up-instant) attribute can now be followed with the keyboard.
- Fragments that are being [destroyed](/up.destroy) now get an [`[aria-hidden=true]`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-hidden_attribute)
  attribute while its disappearance is being animated. When a fragment is being swapped with a new version, the old fragment version is also
  given `[aria-hidden=true]` while it's disappearing.
- [Modal dialogs](/up.modal) now get an [`[aria-modal=true]`](https://a11ysupport.io/tech/aria/aria-modal_attribute) attribute.



Patterns are now built-in
-------------------------

.content => [up-content]

up.form.config.submit

up.link.config.follow
up.link.config.instant
up.link.config.preload


Smarter bandwidth usage
-----------------------

- Preloading is now automatically disabled on slow connections (data saving, 2G, average response time > 800 ms)
- Only 5 preload requests are queued. Additional preload requests abort the oldest request.
- There is a single concurrency setting (4) for both regular requests and preload requests.
- Preload requests are aborted to make space for regular requests.
- The queue is now last-in-first-out. The assumption is that recently queued requests are caused by a recent user interaction.
- User navigation aborts existing requests.



Major breaking changes
----------------

Flavors are out, use up:layer:opening

Modal styles

```
<div class="up-modal">
  <div class="up-modal-viewport">
    <div class="up-modal-dialog">
      <div class="up-modal-content">
      <div class="up-modal-dismiss">


<up-modal>
  <up-modal-viewport>
    <up-modal-box>
      <up-modal-content>
      <up-modal-dismiss>


<div class="up-popup">
  <div class="up-popup-content">


<up-popup>
  <up-modal-content>
```

[up-layer=modal] used to mean "in an existing modal", it now means "open a new modal".




Stability
--------

- When a compiler throws an error, other compilers will now run anyway
- When a destructor throws an error, other destructors will now run anyway
