Layers
------

Infiniftely nested layers

Layers can be accepted or dismissed, with a result value




Server integration
------------------

Server can close layers

Server can emit events

Rails: Values survive redirect

Server: Knows if a request targets an overlay



Context
-------

It's a virtual cookie for the current tab

Not actual a cookie

Layer-specific

Can be read and changed from the server
