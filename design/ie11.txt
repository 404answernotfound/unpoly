Code we can remove once we drop IE11
====================================

Quick wins: Deprecate in unpoly-migrate.js and remove from unpoly.js
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Quick wins: Removals
--------------------

- Do we want to replace ScrollMotion / RevealMotion with native { behavior: 'smooth' }?
  - I think so
  - Chrome's behavior for parallel scrolling is simply that the later call overrides the scroll target for the earlier call
  - We don't get a promise for the scrolling, but do we really need that?
  - We can no longer control the scroll duration. This would be fine, just document it.


More work required
------------------

- In up.util, remove traditional `for` loops with `for..of` loops so methods work on iteratable objects
- up.util.toArray => Array.from
  - But Array.from() always makes a new object
- We may be able to leverage structuredClone() for up.util.copy()
- Replace up.error.* with custom error classes that extend `Error`
  - This may not be transpilable to ES5
- Maybe replace up.Params.fromForm() with new FormData()
  - However, we also use up.Params.fromFields() in FieldWatcher
- maybe don't even have a ES5 build?
