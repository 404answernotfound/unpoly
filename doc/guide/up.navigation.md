This module marks up link elements with classes indicating that
they are currently loading (class `up-active`) or linking
to the current location (class `up-current`).
  
The current location is either:
  
- the URL displayed in the browser window's location bar
- the source URL of a currently opened {{#crossLink "up.modal"}}modal dialog{{/crossLink}} 
- the source URL of a currently opened {{#crossLink "up.popup"}}popup overlay{{/crossLink}}
