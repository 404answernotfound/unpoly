###**
Events
======

Most Unpoly interactions emit DOM events that are prefixed with `up:`.

    $(document).on('up:modal:opened', function(event) {
      console.log('A new modal has just opened!');
    });

Events often have both present ([`up:modal:open`](/up:modal:open))
and past forms ([`up:modal:opened`](/up:modal:opened)).


\#\#\# Preventing events

You can prevent most present form events by calling `preventDefault()`:

    $(document).on('up:modal:open', function(event) {
      if (event.url == '/evil') {
        // Prevent the modal from opening
        event.preventDefault();
      }
    });


\#\#\# A better way to bind event listeners

Instead of using jQuery to bind  an event handler to `document`, you can also
use the more convenient [`up.on()`](/up.on):

    up.on('click', 'button', function(event, $button) {
      // $button is a jQuery collection containing
      // the clicked <button> element
    });

This improves jQuery's [`on`](http://api.jquery.com/on/) in multiple ways:

- Event listeners on [unsupported browsers](/up.browser.isSupported) are silently discarded,
  leaving you with an application without JavaScript. This is typically preferable to
  a soup of randomly broken JavaScript in ancient browsers.
- A jQuery object with the target element is automatically passed to the event handler
  as a second argument. You no longer need to write `$(this)` in the handler function.
- You use an [`up-data`](/up-data) attribute to [attach structured data](/up.on#attaching-structured-data)
  to observed elements.

@class up.bus
###
up.bus = do ->
  
  u = up.util
  e = up.element

  isBooting = true
  appListeners = {}

  ###**
  Listens to an event on `document`.

  The given event listener which will be executed whenever the
  given event is [triggered](/up.emit) on the given selector:

      up.on('click', '.button', function(event, $element) {
        console.log("Someone clicked the button %o", $element);
      });

  This is roughly equivalent to binding an event listener to `document`:

      $(document).on('click', '.button', function(event) {
        console.log("Someone clicked the button %o", $(this));
      });

  Other than jQuery, Unpoly will silently discard event listeners
  on [unsupported browsers](/up.browser.isSupported).

  \#\#\# Attaching structured data

  In case you want to attach structured data to the event you're observing,
  you can serialize the data to JSON and put it into an `[up-data]` attribute:

      <span class='person' up-data='{ "age": 18, "name": "Bob" }'>Bob</span>
      <span class='person' up-data='{ "age": 22, "name": "Jim" }'>Jim</span>

  The JSON will parsed and handed to your event handler as a third argument:

      up.on('click', '.person', function(event, $element, data) {
        console.log("This is %o who is %o years old", data.name, data.age);
      });

  \#\#\# Unbinding an event listener

  `up.on()` returns a function that unbinds the event listeners when called:

      // Define the listener
      var listener =  function() { ... };

      // Binding the listener returns an unbind function
      unbind = up.on('click', listener);

      // Unbind the listener
      unbind()

  There is also a function [`up.off()`](/up.off) which you can use for the same purpose:

      // Define the listener
      var listener =  function() { ... };

      // Bind the listener
      up.on('click', listener);

      // Unbind the listener
      up.off('click', listener)

  \#\#\# Migrating jQuery event handlers to `up.on()`

  Within the event handler, Unpoly will bind `this` to the
  native DOM element to help you migrate your existing jQuery code to
  this new syntax.

  So if you had this before:

      $(document).on('click', '.button', function() {
        $(this).something();
      });

  ... you can simply copy the event handler to `up.on()`:

      up.on('click', '.button', function() {
        $(this).something();
      });

  @function up.on
  @param {string} events
    A space-separated list of event names to bind.
  @param {string} [selector]
    The selector of an element on which the event must be triggered.
    Omit the selector to listen to all events with that name, regardless
    of the event target.
  @param {Function(event, $element, data)} behavior
    The handler that should be called.
    The function takes the affected element as the first argument (as a jQuery object).
    If the element has an [`up-data`](/up-data) attribute, its value is parsed as JSON
    and passed as a second argument.
  @return {Function}
    A function that unbinds the event listeners when called.
  @stable
  ###
  bind = (args...) ->
    # Silently discard any event handlers that are registered on unsupported
    # browsers and return a no-op destructor
    return (->) unless up.browser.isSupported()

    listener = up.EventListener.fromBindArgs(args)

    # Remember the user-provided listeners so we can clean up during a `reset`
    appListeners[listener.id] = listener unless isBooting

    listener.bind()

    return listener.unbind

  ###**
  Unbinds an event listener previously bound with [`up.on()`](/up.on).

  \#\#\# Example

  Let's say you are listing to clicks on `.button` elements:

      var listener = function() { ... };
      up.on('click', '.button', listener);

  You can stop listening to these events like this:

      up.off('click', '.button', listener);

  Note that you need to pass `up.off()` a reference to the same listener function
  that was passed to `up.on()` earlier.

  @function up.off
  @stable
  ###
  unbind = (args...) ->
    listener = up.EventListener.fromUnbindArgs(args)
    delete appListeners[listener.id] unless isBooting
    listener.unbind()

  ###**
  Emits a event with the given name and properties.

  The event will be triggered as a jQuery event on `document`.

  Other code can subscribe to events with that name using
  [`up.on()`](/up.on) or by [binding a jQuery event listener](http://api.jquery.com/on/) to `document`.

  \#\#\# Example

      up.on('my:event', function(event) {
        console.log(event.foo);
      });

      up.emit('my:event', { foo: 'bar' });
      # Prints "bar" to the console

  @function up.emit
  @param {string} eventName
    The name of the event.
  @param {Object} [eventProps={}]
    A list of properties to become part of the event object
    that will be passed to listeners. Note that the event object
    will by default include properties like `preventDefault()`
    or `stopPropagation()`.
  @param {jQuery} [eventProps.$element=$(document)]
    The element on which the event is triggered.
  @param {string|Array} [eventProps.message]
    A message to print to the console when the event is emitted.
    If omitted, a default message is printed.
    Set this to `false` to prevent any console output.

  Resets Unpoly to the state when it was booted.
  All custom event handlers, animations, etc. that have been registered
  will be discarded.

  This is an internal method for to enable unit testing.

  ###**
  Boots the Unpoly framework.

  **This is called automatically** by including the Unpoly JavaScript files.
